          From 1 September 2017, new cars have been type-approved under the
          World Harmonized Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP), a new, more
          realistic test method for measuring fuel consumption and CO 2
          emissions. From 1 September 2018, ditions, the fuel consumption and
          CO2 emission values measured by the WLTP are in many cases higher than
          those measured by the NEDC. which may vary depending on factors
          including road conditions, weather, vehicle load and driving style.
